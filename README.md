# Price process generator

This library provides various generators of stochastic processes modelling real price processes. The generated synthetic
price data can be used in Monte Carlo simulations (or similar statistical experiments) and potentially even to train ML
algorithms. 

Currently the implemented generators are

- [Geometric Wiener motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion)
- [Geometric LÃ©vy flights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_process)
- [Ising](https://borab96.github.io/IsingPriceDynamics/ising.html)

## Installation

``pip install price_process``

## Usage and documentation

### Hello world

### Custom generator

Custom generators can be implemented by subclassing
